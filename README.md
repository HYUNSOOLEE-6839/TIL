# Today I Learned
<br>

## Day-01
- Study and Summary of Python's Basic Grammar and Calculations.

## Day-02
- **Studied and Summarized**
1. Array programming through the *Numpy-Package*
2. Data_Analysis through the *Pandas-Package*

## Day-03
- **Studied and Summarized**
1. Data-Visualization with *Matplotlib*
2. Prediction of Iris Variety by Basic-Machine-Learning Techniques

## Day-04
- **Studied and Summarize**
1. Found missing data through the *Basic-package(MissingNo)* of data preprocessing
2. learned about the document preprocessing capabilities through the basic methods of *scikit-learn*
3. studied Tokenizer to Wordcloud through the *NLTK* natural language preprocessing package.

### From today,
I am planning to study from the beginning thorugh a new lecture instead of reviewing what I have learned before. üòÅüòÅ
- **Basic_Concepts_01** : The study of Python's *basic concepts* and strings, lists and tuples and dictionaries.
- **Basic_Concepts_02** : Studying *Conditional* and *Repeated Statements*.

## Day-05
- **Basic_Concepts_03** : Definition and use of *Functions*, and study of parameters, *Lambda Functions*
- **Basic_Concepts_04** : Studied various functions implemented within *Module* and studied *class, object and method.* Among them, I studied *Class Inheritance, method override, etc.* in detail.
- **Basic_Concepts_05** : I studied the *Regular Expression*, and found the pattern through various methods such as meta-character and minimum-matching.

## Day-06
- Used *BeautifulSoup4* to crawling the web such as the title and date of the Internet news article.

## Day-07
- Studied Web-Page crawl using *Selenium* and crawled on several pages including Automative-Login and Automative-Searching.
- The operating system that I used to study crawling was Window OS, and I felt that there was a small difference when I used MAC OS this time, and it was a good opportunity to fix the code one by one, not by searching.

## Day-08
- I studied how to handle multi-dimensional data usingn the Numpy and how to change or slicing these data into different dimensions. In particular, the concept of the axis was clearly established, and it was realized that it could be used in various fields or in various fields, and that it was simpler and more convenient to operate a computer by aligning shapes with broadcasting functions.
- Furthermore, using the basic Matplotlib, I was able to graph my defined fuctions or results as desired, and I was able to draw graphs more neatly and easily recognizable through styling each graph.

## Day-09
- Through the Pandas module, I study how to leverage Series and DataFrame to organize, reconstruct, and classify the given data easily.
- Future learning plans will be used in Machine-Learning based on what has been learned and reviewed so far, and I have established a basic concept of what is in Machine-Learning.

## Day-10
- I looked at the types of machine learning, and we also looked at what role each model plays, and what kinds of deep learning exist.
What was impressive was that "the fourth industrial revolution that is happening now" by looking at various techniques such as improving the picture quality or changing the day and night of the background through Deep Learning's "GAN" model.
- It studied the conformity assessment and experimental design process of the model, and established the concept of 'overfitting'.

## Day-11
- I studied the basis of 'statistics' that will be used in whether it is machine learning or deep learning, which were statistical probabilities and distribution, statistical reasoning, and tests.  which were difficult to understand, but I was able to establish concepts by applying them in real life as an example.
